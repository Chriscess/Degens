# DegenToken

DegenToken is an ERC20 token contract that also incorporates functionality for redeeming game items. This Solidity smart contract is designed to facilitate decentralized gaming and token transactions within a decentralized application (DApp) environment.

## Features

- **ERC20 Token**: Implements standard ERC20 token functionality for transferring tokens, checking balances, and approving token transfers.
- **Game Item Redemption**: Allows users to redeem game items by paying the specified token price.
- **Owner Management**: Provides administrative functions for the contract owner, including minting tokens and adding game items.
- **Event Logging**: Emits events to log important transactions and state changes within the contract.
- **Security Measures**: Implements access control mechanisms to ensure that only the contract owner can perform certain functions.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the `DegenToken` contract to a compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum).
2. **Interact with the Contract**: Use a compatible wallet or DApp interface to interact with the deployed contract.
3. **Token Transactions**: Users can transfer Degen tokens, check their balances, and burn tokens if needed.
4. **Game Item Redemption**: Users can redeem game items by paying the specified token price.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the `DegenToken` contract, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including a compatible Ethereum client and development environment.
2. **Compile the Contract**: Compile the Solidity smart contract using a Solidity compiler (e.g., solc).
3. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network of your choice (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, testnet).
4. **Interact with the Contract**: Use a wallet or DApp interface to interact with the deployed contract, including minting tokens, adding game items, and redeeming game items.
